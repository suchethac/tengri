# Hierarchical SFH-PSD recovery — handoff

**Branch:** `worktree-hierarchical-psd-spec` · **PR:** #1479
**Status:** estimator validated and σ recovers truth with 1/√N scaling; **τ is
biased ~10× low and unexplained**. Everything below is measured, not assumed.

---

## 1. What this is

Recover the shared burstiness hyperparameters `sfh_field_psd_sigma` (σ, dex) and
`sfh_field_psd_tau_myr` (τ, Myr) from a population of galaxies, for the
companion PSD paper. Truth injected at **σ = 0.75, τ = 150 Myr**, z = 0.1,
10 broadband filters (GALEX + SDSS + 2MASS), `n_grid = 16`, D = 26 per galaxy.

**Two-step estimator (approach B).** Galaxies are conditionally independent
given (σ, τ), so the shared block is 2-D:

    p(σ, τ | {d}) ∝ p(σ, τ) · Π_i Z_i(σ, τ)

Step 1 fits each galaxy independently under a deliberately wide *interim* prior.
Step 2 reweights those draws onto a 60×60 (σ, τ) quadrature grid. `method="b2"`
is production (importance reweighting with the interim pushforward correction);
`method="b1"` is the marginal-posterior product, kept only as a
differently-wrong cross-check.

## 2. Where it stands

### Works

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Estimator, kernel, grid, quadrature, bounds are correct | Fed the **true** fields on the production grid: σ = 0.734–0.747, τ = 143–152 Myr at N=256 |
| Intervals scale as 1/√N | σ slope **−0.448 ± 0.053**, τ slope **−0.516 ± 0.076** (both PASS, both within 1σ of −0.5) |
| σ recovers truth | Covers 0.75 at N = 4…64 with real Laplace fits |
| B2 beats B1 | Measured 4.6× closer to closed form on the toy |
| Estimator is memory-flat in N | Streaming: 1.07 GB at N=256 vs 7.4 GB materialized |

### Does not work

**τ converges to ~12 Myr against a truth of 150, and *tightens* around the wrong
value.** Its width scales correctly (slope −0.516), so it *passes* the
width-scaling gate while being an order of magnitude off. This is the single
most important open problem.

---

## 3. Bugs found and fixed (each was a real defect)

1. **`min_eigenvalue=1e-6` is a variance *ceiling*, not a regularizer.**
   `run_laplace` floors Hessian eigenvalues then takes `cov = H⁻¹`, so the floor
   *assigns* clipped directions variance 1e6 (std 1000). Measured: galaxy 4 had
   11/26 eigenvalues clipped and ξ std 682, against an expected 1. Ten filters
   constrain ~4 modes of a 16-node field, so ~12 field directions are genuinely
   flat — but an unconstrained direction is not infinitely uncertain: ξ has a
   N(0,1) prior, so variance ≤ 1. Flooring at **1.0** takes ξ std for galaxies
   0/3/4/5 from 1.20/108.1/682.2/85.8 → 0.98/0.94/0.96/0.95 and removes the
   **45–56% pathological rate**. Not universal — only valid because these
   latents are unit-normal in unbounded space.

2. **Interim/grid prior mismatch on τ.** Interim fits use `Uniform(10, 500)` on
   `tau_myr` (linear-uniform); `SharedGrid` geomspaced τ with flat weights
   (log-uniform). B2 divides by the interim pushforward, which is a *fact* about
   how draws were made, not a modelling choice — mismatched by a factor ∝ τ,
   50× end-to-end. Fixed via `SharedGrid.uniform(tau_prior=...)`. **Did not cure
   the railing on its own.**

3. **Thinning i.i.d. Laplace draws.** `thin=8` was carried over from the HMC
   path where it removes autocorrelation. Laplace draws are independent, so it
   discarded 87% of the sample for nothing. ESS 9.4/10.3/3.8 → 25.0/92.3/46.3.
   Default is now method-aware.

4. **Wrong convergence diagnostic.** The estimator consumes the reconstructed
   field `m = L(σ,τ)·ξ`, not ξ. Chains agreeing on ξ (R̂ 0.994–0.998) while
   disagreeing on σ (R̂ 4.4) **disagree on m**. `Posterior.rhat` excludes
   `psd_xi` by default, so this read as "latents converged". The bank now gates
   on field R̂.

5. `make_population` called without required `snr_phot`/`snr_line` (would have
   died on first run); `credible_interval` had `np.exp` without max-subtraction
   (NaN at large N) and `searchsorted` quantizing widths to whole grid cells.

## 4. The open problem: τ

**Ruled out** (each measured, do not re-try):

| Hypothesis | Test | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Kernel/grid/quadrature wrong | Truth fields, same grid | τ = 143–152 ✓ — they're fine |
| Grid bounds too tight | Truth sits comfortably inside | Not it |
| B2 degenerates with field dimension | Toy at n_grid 4→24 | ESS/K stays 0.97 → 0.88, recovers both params. **Refuted** |
| Weight degeneracy | K=500→4000, ESS 3.8→46 | τ unchanged (11.6–29.0 vs 11.9–31.0) |
| Pathological galaxies | Dropped them | τ unchanged |
| τ prior mismatch | Fixed | τ unchanged |
| Field too rough (excess HF power) | lag-1 correlation | true +0.2566 vs healthy Laplace +0.2506 — **same** |
| Not enough HMC compute | 1000/1000 → 4000/4000 | **Worse**: σ 0.597 → 1.000 (ceiling), R̂ 4.42 → 1.61 |

**What this leaves.** The bias is in *what the interim posteriors are*, not in
the estimator. Two live leads:

- **σ is an amplitude** (recoverable from the field's marginal variance, which a
  Gaussian approximation gets right). **τ is a correlation length**, recoverable
  only from joint structure across age nodes — the thing a per-galaxy Gaussian
  is least likely to preserve. That lag-1 matches while τ doesn't suggests the
  discrepancy is at longer lags or higher order. **Next test: compare the full
  empirical covariance across age nodes, truth vs Laplace, not just lag-1.**
- B2 assumes draws come from the *actual* interim posterior. A Laplace Gaussian
  is not one. That bias does not shrink with N — consistent with τ tightening
  around a wrong value. Testing this needs honest HMC posteriors, which means
  addressing the funnel (below).

---

## 5. The funnel (not yet addressed)

`s = L(σ,τ)·ξ` is **bilinear**, so the (σ, ξ) geometry is a funnel. Symptoms:
static HMC R̂(σ) = 4.42 at 1000/1000 and still 1.61 at 4000/4000 while ξ's own
R̂ is 0.994–0.998; and seed-to-seed swings of σ from 0.597 to 1.000.

Machinery exists but is **not usable yet**: `compute_field_gp(..., centering=a)`
is wired (commit `dfec36027`), with `drw_partial_gp_from_zeta` and
`drw_latent_log_prior` from #1355. To sample `a < 1` the loss needs its prior
term corrected at `src/tengri/inference/loss_functions.py:478` — the prior on ζ
becomes `N(0, σ_s^(2−2a) I)`, and the `−n(1−a)·log σ_s` normalizer is **not
optional**.

**NUTS has never been run here.** Every fit this session is `mcmc_hmc` with
fixed `n_leapfrog_steps=100` — the sampler least equipped for varying curvature.
This also makes divergence counts uninformative (blackjax's static-HMC
`divergence_threshold` is 1000, so "zero divergences" means nothing). Note
`dense_mass_matrix=True` at D=26 risks the 20+ GB NUTS warmup documented in
CLAUDE.md; use `dense_mass_matrix=False`.

---

## 6. How to run it

Always `PYTHONPATH=<worktree>/src:.` — the editable install points at the **main**
checkout, which has no `tengri.inference.population`. Scripts hard-fail on this.

```bash
# Fit a bank once (resumable, per-galaxy checkpoints). Laplace ~3.2 s/galaxy;
# mcmc_hmc ~155 s/galaxy.
bash scripts/run_psd_bank.sh 2048 psd_bank_fixed --method laplace \
    --n-samples 1000 --n-chains 4

# Every N by subsetting — the bank is nested, so the first N galaxies ARE the
# N-galaxy population (jax.random.split is prefix-stable; verified to 8192).
PYTHONPATH=src:. JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu python scripts/hierarchical_psd_subset_scaling.py \
    --bank psd_bank_fixed --node-chunk 4
```

`--node-chunk` is the memory knob: peak ≈ `chunk × N × K × 8 × ~15` bytes. At
N=2048, K=4000 use 4 or less.

## 7. Traps

- **The width-scaling gate is necessary, not sufficient.** τ passes it
  (−0.516 ± 0.076) while being 10× wrong. Always check coverage too.
- **Pooling reduces variance, not bias.** Unconverged interim fits at large N
  give a *tighter* wrong answer. Report interim R̂ before the intervals.
- **A single bad galaxy destroys B2.** Field std 1155 → its OU density is ~0
  everywhere but one node, its weight buries the other 499 draws, `logsumexp`
  collapses to `max`, and the posterior pins to a grid corner — *identically at
  every N*. Byte-identical intervals across N means it is not averaging.
- **Laplace R̂ is vacuous** (i.i.d. draws → ~1.0 by construction). Stored as NaN
  deliberately. The Laplace failure mode is the wrong covariance *shape*, which
  no between-chain statistic can see. The field-scale guard is what catches it.
- **Truth-field and toy tests cannot see interim/pushforward mismatches.** With
  K=1 `p_0` is a per-galaxy constant that cancels; the toy generates and scores
  under the same prior.
- **Shared machine.** A total-RSS guard SIGKILLs python largest-first at 15 GB
  across *all* sessions (log: `/tmp/oom_guard_15gb.log`). Silent death with no
  traceback is this, not your bug — read the guard log first. Hence the
  resumable bank.

## 8. Next steps, ranked

1. **Full covariance comparison, truth vs Laplace fields** across age nodes (not
   just lag-1). Cheapest test of the leading τ hypothesis. ~30 min.
2. **Run `mcmc_nuts`** (`dense_mass_matrix=False`) on ~16 galaxies and compare
   field R̂ and τ against static HMC. Never tried; static HMC is the wrong tool
   for a funnel. ~1 h.
3. **Finish partial centering**: the loss-prior correction at
   `loss_functions.py:478`. The principled funnel fix.
4. File the `min_eigenvalue=1e-6` footgun against tengri — it silently inflates
   variance 1e6× for any model with unit-scale priors, and only warns under
   `verbose=True`.
5. Acceptance criteria 3 (two-population separation) and 6 (coverage across ≥3
   realizations) are still unrun. Criterion 2 needs multiple realizations —
   single-realization coverage was over-read earlier in this work.
